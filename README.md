# Stock Data Web Scraper in Golang

This project is a web scraper built in Golang using the Colly library to gather stock data from Yahoo Finance. The slice of strings of company ticker symbols are added from which it automatically iterates over each one, and collects relevant stock information. The scraped data is then saved in a structured .json file within the present working directory.

## Key Features:

‚ú® **Dynamic Stock Selection** ‚Äì Ticker symbols of companies are added in the slice of strings which can easily be added or removed as per the requirement and the scraper collects the latest data for each from Yahoo Finance.

üìÅ **JSON Storage** ‚Äì Collected data is saved as .json for easy access and further analysis.

**üîÑ Customizable Output Format** ‚Äì The scraped data is currently stored as `.json`, could be configured to save in other formats like CSV.
